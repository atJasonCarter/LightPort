TrueData is an advertising delivery platform, designed for marketers.

I joined Truedata in 2018 as their lead (and solo) designer.  Targeted advertising has been an constantly innovating and highly discussed topic over the past few years. When I got the opportunity to join TrueData, I knew I wanted to work with a company that was taking privacy and user security first. So, I joined so that I would have a voice in shaping the future of advertising.

TrueData was a barebones platform before 2018, meaning a lot of the work was being done manually by TrueData Client Managers, rather than giving the keys to the customers to enable them to build the exact audience segments that they wanted. When I first came on, **the site looked a little like this**:

After setting up a robust design system, doing tons of usability studies, and competitive analysis, my project manager Evis Drenova and I **got the site looking like this**:

We got to build some really great products, advocate for our end user, and enabled our customers segments to outperform by 42-73% against our competitors. We had tons of iterations and our bootstrapped team did a fantastic job of executing and pivoting quickly. Here's some of the products I got to work on.
