            TrueDataâ€™s core goal is to help companies find the most accurate

            helped use community feedback and testing to improve and reimagine
            the entire workflow a user goes through. Our users begin by
            describing characteristics of their ideal audience. Next, TrueData
            sends the audience to their Advertising distributer (DSP). Finally,
            TrueData gives Insights and analytics on how the advertisement
